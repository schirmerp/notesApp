#simple sticky note application

#built in functionality to save note, append to previous notes
#and change color of the note.

#While working on labs and other projects I found myself often 
flipping back and forth between app/windows. If i needed to 
include multpile values from one window in the other i would 
typicall put the values in a text document for quick reference
the problem was when i switched windows to look at anything else it would require me to bring the text doc back to the top of the display. 

Sticky notes are simple notes that can be "stuck" to the top of the display so that you wont have to dig around under all your open apps to get your displayed note back!
